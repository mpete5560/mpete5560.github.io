        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Junior at Bob Jones University studying visual arts with a concentration in 
            photography. I work for the Vintage as the Photo Editor.</p>
         <p>
            I currently don't have a home church, but am visiting churches in the area with my Freshman sister. 
            The only website I've had experience with is my account to share digital gelleries for my clients. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy photography when I have time to shoot things that are interesting to me.
